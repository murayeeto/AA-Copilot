To run, run the flask_server.py
and then use npm start in the terminal to launch locally. Unfortunately due to time constraints I most likely will be unable to get the website deployed on github but locally it runs perfectly.

This project uses multiple apis as well as firebase (WHICH WAS HORRIBLE TO GET WORKING AHHHH)
